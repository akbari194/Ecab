		<h2>payment related queries</h2>
		<div class="q">
		  <h3 class="qhead"><a href="#q05">How do I pay after the completion of my trip?</a></h3>
		  <div class="answer" id="q05"><p>You can pay the chauffeur in cash or by debit/credit card (VISA/Master Card/AMEX) as per the fare on the meter with extras, if any, (for waiting or night surcharge) and a printed receipt/e-receipt will be given to you. Please always insist on the printed receipt. If you have any complaints, please fill up our client feedback form. This will help us to resolve your problem quickly.</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="q">
		  <h3 class="qhead"><a href="#q06">Will I get a printed receipt for the amount paid?</a></h3>
		  <div class="answer" id="q06"><p>Always. Please insist on it. Our chauffeurs are trained to give the receipt for every fare they collect. If, by mistake, they donâ€™t, please ask for it.</p></div>
		</div>
    
    <div class="q">
      <h3 class="qhead"><a href="#q07">Can I use the cab without flagging down the meter?</a></h3>
      <div class="answer" id="q07"><p>We track every fare that the cab is taking and actively dissuade our chauffeurs from taking an un-metered fare.<p> An un-metered fare is in violation of the Department of Transport rules and exposes the chauffeur to penal action.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have a complaint against the chauffeur, you would not need a valid printed receipt/e-receipt at the end of your journey to make a valid complaint.</p>
